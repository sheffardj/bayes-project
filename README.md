### Instructions
1. Open `init.R` and run that file to set the working directory, read in the libraries, and set the seed.
2. The one dimensional script `1d.R` in the root is self contained and should output all plots and tables used in the paper. Some logic gates `if(0)` might need to be switched into `if(1)` for plots and `gt` tables.
3. The two dimensional case is handled in the folder called `2d` where all the subscripts are coordinated in the script `2d.R`, which calls `case.R`, `simpsons2d.R`, `estimate.R` and `prior-post.R`. The script `2d.R` also has logic gates that may be switched off to speed up sourcing the script or on to plot figures and tables used in the paper.
